### Task 1 (Currency Converter):

- Create a class Converter that has RSD and currency as attributes.
- Currency is an enum, while RSD is an integer.
- You can input values for RSD and currency through the constructor, and there are setters, but there are no getters.
- Create a method for converting currency to the one specified through the constructor or setter (this means converting RSD to that specific currency).
- Use if-else or switch for comparisons in the method.
- Create an object of type Converter and test it for all currencies - EUR, USD, AUD, CAD, RUB, and GBP.

### Task 2 (Java Math):

- Create a static method in the main function that functions like SQL's min, max, sum, avg, and distinct using ArrayList<Integer>.
- You don't need to create another class except for the main class.
- The methods should accept ArrayList<Integer> as a parameter.
- The distinct method returns a new ArrayList<Integer>, while the other methods have return types of int (for min, max, and sum) and double (for avg).
